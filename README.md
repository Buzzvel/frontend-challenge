# Buzzvel Frontend Challenge

First, thank you for your interest in being part of our team ü§©  !
Below you will find all the information you need to start your test.

## Warnings before starting

- Create a repository on your GitHub **without citing anything related to Buzzvel**.
- Make your commits to your repository.
- After completing the test, fill out this form **from the responsible recruiter**.
- You will be able to consult Google, Stackoverflow or any other site.
- Take a look at [Useful Materials](#useful-materials).
- Take a look at what the [interview](#for-the-day-of-the-technical-interview) will be like
- Feel free to ask any questions at challenge@buzzvel.com.
- Rest assured, breathe, press the feel because just like you, we've also been through this stage ü•∞!

### About the application environment:

- Here at the company, we are very adept at PHP - Laravel, to build our backend applications and MySql to build our databases.
- We are quite adept at using Docker to mount development environments
- We value a good container structure created by you.
- We value a good folder structure in the project.
- We value good code writing.
- We value great code documentation.

## For the day of the technical interview
On the date set by the recruiter, have your application running on your local machine to run the tests and to show us the points developed and possible questions.
We will do a code review together with you as if you were already on our team ‚ù§Ô∏è, you will be able to explain what you thought, how you architected and how the project can evolve.

## Objective: Challenge Buzzvel

### Story
Jo√£o is tired of using business cards for his business. He liked having a picture on
his phone so that people scanning it could see all of their data on one page.
Your goal is to create a tool that helps Jo√£o solve his problem in a simple way.

### How it will work?
- Page that generates the QR Code with URL (example: buzzvel.com/{name})
- John Mobile Image
- Page that redirects from QR Code URL to John Page (/john)

- Code complexity
- Cyclomatic Complexity
- Performance
- Comments

### Bonus Points

 - If the project is delivered using Docker, a 10% bonus will be given on this
task.
 - If the project is delivered using Tests, a 20% bonus will be given on this
task.

Present your solution using the framework you want, justifying your choice.
Make sure you fulfill most of the requirements, as you can partially fulfill them and during the evaluation we will chat about what was missing.

Qualitative correction will be made during the interview and will take into account the following criteria:


## What will be evaluated and valued :heart:
- Documentation
- If you go for a senior position, focus a lot on the **architecture drawing**
- Clean and organized code (nomenclature, etc)
- Knowledge of patterns (PSRs, design patterns, SOLID)
- Be consistent and know how to argue your choices
- Present solutions that you master
- Data Modeling
- Code maintainability
- Error handling
- Beware of security items
- Architecture (structuring thought before writing)
- Affection in decoupling components (other layers, service, repository)

According to the above criteria, we will evaluate your test to proceed to the technical interview.
If you have not acceptably achieved what we are proposing above, we will not proceed with the process.

## What will NOT be evaluated :warning:
- registration flow
- Frontend (we will only evaluate the (Restful API)[https://www.devmedia.com.br/rest-tutorial/28912])
- Authentication

## What will be a Differential?
- Docker usage
- [integration](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing) tests
- Use of Design Patterns
- Documentation
- Proposal for architectural improvement
